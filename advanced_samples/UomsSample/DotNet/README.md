Developed against DotNet 3.1.

## Running the sample

Configure the sample using the file [appsettings.placeholder.json](UomsSample/appsettings.placeholder.json). Before editing, rename this file to `appsettings.json`. This repository's `.gitignore` rules should prevent the file from ever being checked in to any fork or branch, to ensure credentials are not compromised.

Replace the placeholders in the `appsettings.json` file with your TenantID, NamespaceId, ClientID and ClientSecret.
