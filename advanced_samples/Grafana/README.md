# Grafana Sequential Data Store Sample

**Version:** 1.0.1

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_apis/build/status/product-readiness/OCS/Grafana_NodeJS?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_build?definitionId=1680&branchName=master)

This sample demonstrates how to build a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) plugin that runs queries against the Sequential Data Store of OSIsoft Cloud Services or Edge Data Store. The sample performs normal "Get Values" calls against a specified stream in SDS, using the time range of the Grafana dashboard. See the [Grafana Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/) for more information on developing Grafana plugins.

## Requirements

- [Grafana 7.0+](https://grafana.com/grafana/download)
- Web Browser with JavaScript enabled
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- If using OSIsoft Cloud Services, register a Client Credentials Client in OSIsoft Cloud Services; a client secret will need to be provided to the sample plugin configuration
- If using Edge Data Store, the browser must be running local to a running copy of Edge Data Store

## Running the Sample

1. Copy this folder to your Grafana server's plugins directory, like `.../grafana/data/plugins`
1. (Optional) If using other plugins, rename the folder to `osisoft-cloud-services-sample`
1. Open a command prompt inside that folder
1. Install dependencies, using `npm ci`
1. Build the plugin, using `npm run build` (or `npm run dev` for browser debugging)
1. Restart the Grafana server to load the new plugin
1. Add a new Grafana datasource using the sample (see [Grafana docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/datasources/add-a-data-source/))
1. Choose whether to query against OSIsoft Cloud Services or Edge Data Store
1. Enter the relevant required information; if using OCS, the client secret will be encrypted in the Grafana server and HTTP requests to OCS will be made by a server-side proxy, as described in the [Grafana docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/authentication/)
1. Open a new or existing Grafana dashboard, and choose the Sequential Data Store Sample as the data source
1. Enter your Namespace (if querying OCS) and Stream, and data will populate into the dashboard from the stream for the dashboard's time range

## Running the Automated Tests

1. Open a command prompt inside this folder
1. Install dependencies, using `npm ci`
1. Run the tests, using `npm test`
