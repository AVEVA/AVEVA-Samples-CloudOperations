# PI to Cds Read Data Samples

The sample code in the folders below demonstrate how to invoke SDS REST APIs via the sample client libraries to read data from PI to CDS streams ingressed to CONNECT data services.
The steps performed in the samples are similar and follow the general flow as shown on [Read Data Docs](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/data-hub/page/api-reference/sequential-data-store/sds-read-data-api.html):

1. Authenticate against Cds
1. Retrieve stream
1. Retrieve Window events
1. Retrieve Window events in table form
1. Retrieve Window events using paging
1. Retrieve Range events
1. Retrieve Interpolated events
1. Retrieve Filtered events
