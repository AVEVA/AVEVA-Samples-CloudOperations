# ADH Assets Samples

The assets samples demonstrate how to invoke Assets REST APIs via the sample client libraries and direct REST API calls.
The steps performed in these samples follow the same basic pattern.

1. Obtain an OAuth token for ADH, using a client-credentials client
1. Create an SDS type
1. Create an SDS stream
1. Insert data into the stream
1. Create an ADH asset
1. Create an ADH asset type
1. Create an asset from an asset type
1. Retrieve an asset
1. Retrieve a resolved asset
1. Update an asset
1. Retrieve the updated asset
1. Retrieve data from an asset
1. Retrieve status for an asset
1. Search for an asset by asset type id
1. Clean up assets, asset types, stream, and type
