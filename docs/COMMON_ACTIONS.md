# ADH Commmon Actions

These samples showcase some of the commonly performed actions in SDS. These include creating, updating, deleting, and reading ADH types and streams.

## [WaveForm](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/main/docs/SDS_WAVEFORM.md)

This sample highlights using ADH with an integer based index. All of the principles and actions shown here apply to time-series indexed streams as well. Please see the [WaveForm](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/main/docs/SDS_WAVEFORM.md) ReadMe for a complete listing of operations shown.

## [Time-Series](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/main/docs/SDS_TIME_SERIES.md)

This sample highlights using ADH with a time-series based index. All of the principles and actions shown here apply to a non-time-series indexed streams as well. Please see the [Time-Series](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/blob/main/docs/SDS_TIME_SERIES.md) ReadMe for a complete listing of operations shown.
