# Using the OCS Dataview Service in Python

**Version:** 0.2.4

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_apis/build/status/product-readiness/OCS/DataViews_Python?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/osieng/engineering/_build?definitionId=885&branchName=master)

The sample code in this demonstrates how to invoke the Data View REST API via the sample Python client [library](https://github.com/osisoft/OSI-Samples-OCS/tree/master/library_samples/Python). The sample demonstrates how to establish a connection to SDS, obtain an authorization token, create an SdsType and SdsStream with data (if needed), create a Dataview, update it, retrieve it, and retrieve data from it in different ways. At the end of the sample, everything that was created is deleted.

This example uses the ocs_sample_library_preview library which is also included in this github repo. It is downloadable via pip.

Developed against Python 3.7.2.
